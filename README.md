# nodeBlog
A Sample Blog Using Node.js and Express

Technologies Used: Node.js, mongoose, express, body-parser, Javascript, Semantic UI

Why did I create it?

  I created this project to practice my CRUD and creating RESTful routes with Node.js. 
  I wanted to experiment with using a new css framework too (Semantic UI) which has its advantages over bootstrap.
  And to have FUN!

What's it for?

  This is a template that I or others can use to expand upon to create a robust blog site. 

What's cool about it?
  
  I really like its versatility and clean design. The site is a true representation of RESTful best practices.

How does it help people?
  
  As a model for Node.js RESTful routing, hopefully others can follow my code to help them get their first Node.js site into production.
